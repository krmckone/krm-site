<p>Hey, thanks for checking out the project. It's currently in development. I'll be making posts soon.</p>

<p>This website has been a work in progress for a long time now, probably several years at this point. It started out as a jekyll site, then moved to gatsby, and then landed here where it's built by a custom static asset generator written in Go and deployed by GH Actions. It's been picked up and dropped by myself lots of times, mainly due to peaks in motivation and sudden drops in interest. I think the biggest reason I have not been able to consistently work on this site (both the implementation and content) has been this: I have not been able to figure out who a site that I maintain would be for. If I'm not the audience (should a site always directly benefit its owner?), then should I make it for someone else?</p>
<p>I once thought it could be a site for my personal and work notes. I do not need an internet-hosted site for that though. All of my problem-solving/professional notes are either hand written in my rocket book or in my Notion for easy access. Who would benefit from that? All the context would be missing and would be a lot of work to fill it in, assuming I remember it.</p>
<p>Later I thought it could be something for longer-winded expansion on things that I have taken on recently, whether that be games or programming or whatever. There's a lot of sites out there that are vying for your attention already. I didn't want my site to just be another blog about explaining ruby methods, gave cheat codes/guides, or gave anecdotal advice on how to surely pass the coding interview. It would probably never be seen (I don't expect it to be seen regardless), and haphazardly skimmed at best.</p>
<p>It could be something more real, like expanding on certain topics such as Christianity, other religions, study habits, mathematics, etc. There's a lot out there on that too and I don't think I'm really one to preach to the choir. I don't expect that I would do much better than the content that's already out there.</p>
<p>If I were to have a website that I contributed to sometimes (I can't promise more than sometimes), I want it to be something that could capture my own attention for long periods, not just something that I'm hoping will capture the seconds-long attention of random people meandering around on the internet. Do some people put out content for the sake of putting out content on the internet, regardless of whether or not they would actually find passion in returning to it later, as someone who experiences it first hand as if they were the consumer and not the original creator? I think so, and I think it's possible that this sort of creator just wants to be seen and elevated through volume and projection.</p>
<p>I don't want this site to be about things like that. I want it to be about things that deeply capture my attention, in the same way that the things I find great satisfaction in daily also capture my attention. Not everyone enjoys the same things that I do and not everyone likes thinking or focusing on one or two things for long periods of time, and that's perfectly fine. I just know for myself that is where I find my greatest enjoyment, and that's what I hope to share on this site. If you like things that respect your attention and allow you to go deep, then I figure this site is for you as well.</p>
